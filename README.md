# Detection-of-synchronization-between-stereo-frames

<h1> Introduction </h1>
<p>Detecting synchronization between stereo frames is a critical aspect of stereo vision in computer vision. This process ensures that images captured by two cameras are perfectly aligned in time, eliminating jitter or delays. Achieving synchronization is vital for accurate depth estimation, object tracking, and other computer vision tasks that rely on temporal consistency. The detection involves matching features like edges, textures, and colors between stereo frames and applying transformations for precise alignment.</p>

<h1>Need for Frame Synchronization:</h1>
<ul>
It is an absolute requirement for efficient video effects or glitch-free source switching.
For moving cameras or objects, temporal asynchrony may lead to spatially displaced views, false parallax and ghosting effects that can have a significant impact on the perceived 3D quality.
To eliminate the relative delay between left and right images.
If the stereo frames are not properly synchronized, the correspondence between the left and right images will be disrupted, which will result in inaccurate depth information and potentially cause problems for 3D reconstruction
